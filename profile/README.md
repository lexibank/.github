Lexibank is a curated collection of lexical datasets.

The Lexibank infrastructure consists of

- a dataset specification based on CLDF Wordlists
- a registry of published Lexibank datasets on Zenodo
- `pylexibank` - a `cldfbench` plugin to curate lexibank datasets

Candidates for new lexibank datasets are triaged as issues at https://github.com/lexibank/.github/issues
